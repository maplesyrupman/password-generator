#Password Generator

This application generates a random password based on the criteria a user provides. 

The criteria a user has to choose from include:
    * Upper case letters
    * Lower case letters
    * Numbers
    * Special Characters
    * Password length

After making valid selections for each required criterium, the user then clicks the "Generate Password" button and a randomly generated string is written to the screen for the user to copy.
